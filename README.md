1. Sign Language Translation
Description: Converts sign language gestures into text or speech using computer vision and machine learning techniques, enabling communication between hearing-impaired individuals and others.
Input: Real-time video streams or pre-recorded videos/images capturing hand and finger movements (RGB).
Output: Translated text or synthesized speech corresponding to the detected sign language gestures.

2. Crowd Counting
Description: Estimates the number of people in crowded scenes using image processing and deep learning to enhance public safety, monitor congestion, and manage event spaces effectively.
Input: Static images or live video feeds from surveillance cameras or drones (RGB).
Output: Estimated crowd count and density maps with possible bounding boxes or dot annotations over detected individuals.

3. Food Quality Assessment in Agriculture
Description: Analyzes images of fruits, vegetables, or crops to assess quality, detect ripeness, or identify diseases using computer vision and AI, aiding farmers in making informed decisions.
Input: High-resolution images of agricultural produce (RGB) captured using smartphones, cameras, or drones.
Output: Classification of produce quality (e.g., good, overripe, diseased) and detection of defects or diseases using bounding boxes or segmentation masks.
